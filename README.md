# Biodiversity Analysis - Protection Status of Endangered Species

A Python-based analysis of National Park biodiversity data, centered around conservation status.

## Overview

This project uses Python - including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy. I employ bar graphs, pie charts, and chi-square testing to develop an understanding of conservation statuses between different species at different national parks in the United States. Furthermore, this project showcases chain (itertools) to clean the data - making it easier to interpret at a glance.

Project done in March 2023.

## Statement

This is my own original work.
